# Spotify-ETL-Pipeline


# This is my personal project where I wanted make an ETL pipeline using the Spoitfy API to extract song data and transform, clean it and put it into a data lake for analysis.
# Technologies I used was python pandas for cleaning and transforming, spotify api for extracting song data and aws lambda with terraform for deployment. Github used for version control and   saving progress and documenting it.
